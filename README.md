# Data Science Regression Analysis

This project focuses on applying regression techniques to analyze and predict
a continuous target variable using a real-world dataset. The main objective
is to demonstrate the complete data science workflow from data preprocessing
to model evaluation.

## Project Overview
The project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Regression model implementation
- Model performance evaluation
- Visualization and interpretation of results

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature selection and transformation
   - Outlier detection

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Statistical summaries
   - Data distribution analysis
   - Visualization using plots

3. **Regression Modeling**
   - Building regression models to predict continuous outcomes
   - Training and testing model performance

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R² Score

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Results
The regression model performance was evaluated using standard metrics, and
the results were analyzed to understand prediction accuracy and model behavior.
Visualizations were used to support model interpretation.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical experience in data analysis, regression
modeling, and performance evaluation, highlighting analytical thinking and
hands-on data science skills.
